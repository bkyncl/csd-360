                    I had always been fascinated by the night sky, but I never really understood what the positions of the stars and planets meant.
                    Until one day, when I was young, I learned about the positions of the stars and planets in the sky, and how they could be useful for navigation and tracking time. 
                    I learned how to find the <span id="one">_________________________</span>, which is always in the same position in the sky and can be used to find direction if I ever am lost. 
                    I also learned how the positions of the planets could be used to predict future astronomical events, like <span id="two">_________________________</span>.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then in school I learned how to look through a telescope.  Later, when I peered through the eyepiece I was amazed by what I saw. The moon looked like it was right in front of me, 
                    and I could see craters and mountains on its surface. I learned that these craters and mountains were formed through a combination of <span id="three">_________________________</span>.
                    I saw Jupiter and its four largest moons, and Saturn with its beautiful rings. I realized that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky were not just beautiful to look at, but also had practical 
                    applications. Because by studying the positions and movements of planets in our solar system, we can understand the overall motion of the solar system through the galaxy. Which provides insight on 
                    how our solar system formed and allows us <span  id="four">_________________________</span>.
